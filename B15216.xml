            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Reader, before thou take pains in perusing these my poore meditations, I thought good first to giue thee an account of my selfe and this Labour. Hauing in my yonger yeeres sucked some sweets of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, from the Vniuersities of <hi>Strasburge, Heidleberge, Wittemberge,</hi> and <hi>Lipnick,</hi> in <hi>Germany;</hi> as also <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Geneua,</hi> in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Sauoy;</hi> but chiefly from the famous
<pb facs="tcp:176970:3"/> Vniuersitie of <hi>Oxford;</hi> in my manly yeeres, <hi>Mars</hi> distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted me from the Studies of <hi>Minerua:</hi> but when that Planet was set, I retired to a Countrey life: And now hauing in my old age (I thanke my God) receiued satiety of all worldly bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, it hath pleased His Goodnesse, to incline my heart to more supernal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations; which I did commit to writing, for the benefit of my children (with whom God hath plentifully blessed mee) that thereby, when I am departed from them, they may finde a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of my labours for their practice and imitation. I beganne with <hi>Moses,</hi> and haue drawne paralels out of the Old Testament, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb facs="tcp:176970:3"/> the Lawes of <hi>Israel</hi> with our Ciuill and municipall; and the auncient formes of warre with the moderne; and the sinnes of former A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, rebuked by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, with the enormities of our times, and GODS Iudgements on them both.</p>
            <p>Secondly, proceeding to the New Testament, I found the three former Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists easily drawne into a Harmony, by the context of the History: But this of S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Iohn,</hi> as written the last in time, so it appeareth, as it were, the <hi>Metaphysicke</hi> of the Gospell. I therfore helped my selfe with the expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the auncient Fathers, and some of the late Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; whose iudgements, when the place was diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
<pb facs="tcp:176970:4"/> I haue set downe in their own words. The work thus growne to a reasonable Volume, I imparted it to some Learned men, who with much importunity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged me to put it to the Presse; whereas I neuer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, but that it should lye Leiger with my other Papers. The words are my ordinary style, which I gaue free passage vnto, auoyding all spirituall pride, and not seeking ostentation or fame. I humbly therefore craue pardon of the reuerend and learned Diuines, for aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing on so high a taske; my endeuour being, not to make meate for the children of the Prophets, but to draw milke from the bosome where my Lord leaned, for
<pb facs="tcp:176970:4"/> the nourishing of such babes as my selfe; though I wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both <hi>Moses</hi> Rod, and <hi>Samsons</hi> strength, to bring water from so hard a Rocke, and honey from so strong a Lyon. I wish peace both to the Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; and that it were in my power to aduance so happy a worke. And rather thā Gods cause should suffer (as old and vnable as I am) I would, with a cheerefull heart, once againe aduance my Arme with my vtmost strength, to helpe the Lord against the mighty, and to assist in fighting his battels. In the meane time, I craue a charitable acceptance of what I haue weakely perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in another kind; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I haue laboured to auoyd
<pb facs="tcp:176970:5"/> both tediousnes and offence; for which cause, I haue set downe some words of the Text in the margent, for the Reader's direction, hoping hee will supply the rest with his owne paines. Wherein I haue falne short, or strayed, I desire to be reduced vnto the right way by more able iudgements. This Mite I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to Gods Treasury, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hope or expectation of any Talent of reward, but when I haue done all I can, acknowledging my selfe an vprofitable Seruant.</p>

            <head>To the READER.</head>
            <p>WE may truly in this Age take vp the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans complaint, There is no end of writing Bookes; ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there among the many intemperancies of our time, any greater or more hurtfull. As when there is a rot of Cattell, sound meates are not saleable, by reason the bad is so cheape and plentifull; so our frothy Pamphlets infect the ignorāt, &amp; discourage more able iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from writing at all, <hi>Ne in magno populo non ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noscantur.</hi> I say againe, There is no end of writing many Bookes: for, what good is ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:176970:6"/> intended or attayned? Errors are rather multiplyed in questions of controuersie: the best wits are imployed in the mystery of Satan, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der feedeth vpon the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals Swads, and no proficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy (which ought to be the end of writing Bookes) made ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in truth or in godlinesse. Wee taste no meate at all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some condiment, but such are powdred strongly, which wee keepe for store. So ought all our speeches to be seazoned with salt, to minister grace and edification to the hearers; But when we commend words and conceptions to the posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<q>Victurus genium debet habere Liber:</q> Or, to vse the words of our learned Apostle, A booke ought
<pb facs="tcp:176970:6"/> to bee <hi>a platforme of sound words,</hi> that the Reader by his proficiency may become the Booke it selfe, and the Crowne of the Author. Such is this Booke presented to thy view: the Noble Knight, the Writer thereof, hath conuerted all his learning into godly knowledge, and his knowledge (as Saint <hi>HIEROME</hi> aduiseth) into practice. There is no teaching comparable to that which is experimentall. It was our Lords direction to Saint <hi>PE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER, Tu conuersus, confirma fratres.</hi> This and many other his meditations are an account he maketh to the World, of his time piously spent, and an es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say of that happy treasure in his heart, out of the abundance whereof these lines haue procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. His seruice to his Prince
<pb facs="tcp:176970:7"/> and Countrey, both in peace and warre, his abundant cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to the poore, his so many children religiously educated, his hospitality such, that his house is becomen <hi>(quae vidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus testamur)</hi> a Colledge where learned men of all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions are entertayned. All these are here modelled to thy instruction and imitation: Neyther (to the incouragement of all good Protestants, who doe not incline to the errours eyther of the right hand or of the left) hath his labour beene in vaine in the Lord: for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that hee hath cleared and improued his estate left him by his valiant and liberall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without any grieuance to his Tenants, of twelue Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren (nine of them sonnes) hee hath not lost one: but all of
<pb facs="tcp:176970:7"/> them are seuerally imployed in worthy callings, some within, some without the Land. Let it be still the glory of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that wee haue not in Church onely able Diuines, who with their wings doe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Arke of the testimony, but that our Gentry also doe i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate their learned King, who, besides the Sword, doth handle the Pen of the Writer, and ouercommeth

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:176970:10"/> beeing heere termed the <hi>Word,</hi> proceeding from God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the expresse Image of the counsell of his Father, we may presume, I humbly hope, to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, That God pleaseth to make himselfe knowne to vs, poore wretched men, by his diuine Word. The word <hi>Logos</hi> in the Originall Greeke, doth not only signifie the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>(Word;)</hi> but also a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, consisting of a Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a Reason, and a Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

                     <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> The third day a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</note>MArriages were in those dayes solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with inuitations and friendly meetings: Our blessed Lady was a Guest at her Neighbours house; so was our Sauiour, who gaue honour to lawfull Matrimony by his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly presence, and hee was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uited single, but his Disciples also, and such as followed him. It is a kindly vsage, that loue and house-keeping should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with chearefulnes and hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality: which yet was not on the Sabbath day to hinder holy exercises, but the third day of the Weeke.</p>
               <p>I haue heard a Question by many oft demanded, What warrant there is in the Word of God, That it belongeth to the Minister to ioyne Man and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:176970:18"/> Wife together in Marriage? for (say they) we read no prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, no not in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament; &amp; in this place here, is mention made that Christ was present at the Nuptiall Feast, but no word that eyther hee, or any of his Disciples, or any of the Iewish Priests, did celebrate the Marriage. And from this pretended silence of the Scripture, some haue groū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded an opinion, yea, and a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice also, that the solemnization of marriage may be performed by the Parents, or any Officer not Ecclesiasticall, appoynted by the Magistrate. I will free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set downe, what I haue col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in graduall Conclusions, referring the determination to better iudgements.</p>
               <p>When Marriage in the state of innocency was ordayned, God himselfe brought the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to the Man. From whence I gather; first, that no persons
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:176970:19"/> can marry themselues, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Contracts betweene par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are not sufficient: for thus in very deed do Beasts, but man must be married. Now, because there was not a third person in the World, therefore God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe ioyned them together. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it is not sufficient to haue witnesses, but there must be one who must marry them, which is meant by the words, God brought the woman to the man: and before, it is there said, A helpe meet for him, (<hi>that is,</hi> a Wife;) which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in the Latine word, <hi>Coniux:</hi> thirdly, he that marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the parties, must be <hi>Vice Dei,</hi> which is the Minister; more then any other Officer: fourthly, hee must be such an one, whereof <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> then stood need of. Now the Magistrates Office was not then needfull, before sinne en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, no not of the man ouer his
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:176970:19"/> wife, as appeareth by the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans punishment, <hi>Genes.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Hee shall rule ouer thee.</hi> Last of all, according to the rule, <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum in quolibet genere est mens, &amp; regula caeterorum;</hi> What was done in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue's</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, must be obserued in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: as the infusion of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam's</hi> soule is the maine Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to procure it to be so in mankinde.</p>
               <p>Next, vnder the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, although the ministery of holy things were not so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly expressed, yet the first-borne supplyed them all, the Priesthood being one of his three priuiledges. Although therefore wee doe not distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reade who did offer sacrifice, circumcise, kill the Passeouer, take Tithes, and so of Marriage, Buriall, and the like; yet wee find euer, that the eldest or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the family did them. To make this plaine, see <hi>Genes.</hi> 14.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:176970:20"/> 18, 19. For <hi>Melchezedek</hi> was the Priest of the most high God, (and then it immediately followes) Therefore he blessed <hi>Abraham.</hi> As if he should say, it was relatiuely proper onely to the Priests to blesse. The Apostle vseth this reason, to proue the dignity both of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedek</hi> and <hi>Christs Priesthood, Heb.</hi> 7.7. Now marriage, as appeareth in the first instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was not to be solemnized without blessing, <hi>Genes.</hi> 1.18. And therefore it belonged, and was performed onely by the Priests.</p>
               <p>In the time of the Law, the same order, and that more pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually was obserued. Indeed, for their <hi>Minora Sacra</hi> (as we terme them, Sacramentals) they did not alwayes goe vp to Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem: But their houses in their seuerall inheritances, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to bee so many Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels of Ease. This is proued,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:176970:20"/>
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 20.5. They had no Church-yards; their Fields, Gardens, and Houses were sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifized to it, the whole Land of Promise being sacramentall.</p>
               <p>But their Burials, Thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuings, Domesticall prayers, Catechizing, and so (no doubt) their Marriages, were celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and done by the Priests and Leuites, as is proued, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.12, 18, 19. and 14.27. for they had no Synagogues, vntill their returne from captiuitie. But to cleare this poynt, see <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.18. The Priest is to iudge, among other things, of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies betwixt bloud and bloud, that is, of degrees of marriage: for so it is expressed by the Septuagint and the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, according to the originall, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 18.6. <hi>Nemo proximam sanguinis sui accedat:</hi> Let no man approch the neerest of his bloud. And the Prophet rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning the sinnes of the Land,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:176970:21"/> after hee had named whoring, addeth, <hi>Bloud toucheth bloud,</hi> that is Incest: So that hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be arbitrator betweene bloud and bloud, is to bee a Iudge of Consanguinity, Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and Marriage. So wee reade, that the Leuites and Priests kept the Genealogies of those who were true Israelites, as it were the Registers of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and diuorced the strange wiues from them of the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13.3, 30.</p>
               <p>In the New Testament, our Sauior doth wholly referre vs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. to the first Marriage of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> making the rule, <hi>Ab initio non fuit sic.</hi> Saint <hi>Marke,</hi> Chapter 10. adds, <hi>Ab initio creationis,</hi> perpetuall against diuorces, which had beene tolerated by <hi>Moses.</hi> So Saint <hi>Paul</hi> referres vs to the same fountaine, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. and Epistles 5.30, 31. See the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The Fathers of the Church
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:176970:21"/> by Analogy doe vrge the same against <hi>Polygamy,</hi> though <hi>(de facto)</hi> practised by the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches: whereby wee see, that in all things concerning Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, wee are to looke backe to the first institution. And if (as before is shewed) GOD himselfe did solemnize the first marriage, wee are for euer so to regulate the same; for no Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, nor Lay person, can therein supply the roome of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is no exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or act of the Church, wherein our Sauiour, the three former Euangelists, and the Apostles Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and Saint <hi>Peter</hi> doe vse more resolutions, decisions and conclusions, then about the matter of marriage. See <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> 19.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.24, 25, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 7.25, 26, <hi>&amp;c. Rom.</hi> 7.2. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.31. <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.2, 3, <hi>&amp;c. Luk.</hi> 16.18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:176970:22"/> 7.2, 3, 4, <hi>&amp;c</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Titus</hi> 2.4, 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.34, 35. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. <hi>Coloss.</hi> 3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.3. and many other places ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing duties and rules of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation, inseperation, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorce, cases of consent, diuers Religions, Children borne in marriage, women in widdow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, &amp;c. Nay, the very Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Sacraments, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme and the Supper is not so often insisted vpon. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I gather, that it were a great inconueniency to thinke, that the Institutions, Lawes, and Rules of marriage should bee in one place, and the execution of them in another: the groūds of marriage in the Church, and the celebration in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth. The things of this world were meerely left by Christ to the Lawes and Customes of <hi>Caesar,</hi> Princes and Nations. And professing that his Kingdome was not of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:176970:22"/> this world; our Lords mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was by his Kingdome (as the Iesuits themselues expound that terme, writing on <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.) to expresse the order which Christ established in his Church for the well-gouerning of the faithfull. To shew there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that marriage was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an ordinance of God, but that all abuses concerning the same, which did or might arise since the Creation, are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued by Christ &amp; his Church, this diligence hath beene vsed by the holy Spirit: otherwise, if wedlocke were (as they say) a meere ciuill contract, the doubts about it might haue bin taken away by humane Lawes which now Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles haue settled, and not left subiect to variation, as all ciuill businesses are according to the variation of times and necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Neyther doth this consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration as yet cease: for all
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:176970:23"/> Christians that I know, in any question about marriage, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout diuorces, pre-contracts, nullities, legitimation, and the like, haue euer recourse vnto the Word of GOD; neyther dare they abide any other try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; As the Doctrine of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments is to be sought at the mouthes of those that doe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister them; And although I doe not affirme, that marriage is a Sacrament properly so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, though perhaps that of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> and <hi>Salomon</hi> was; yet without question Marriage, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of Christians, are to be imitated and celebrated by the first borne, which now is Christ, and Christs Legatees, who are the Ministers of the Word.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I finde some passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges euen in the New Testamēt, that euince the Christian Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters Office in this matter. Christ himselfe saith, <hi>Quos De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:176970:23"/> copulauit, homo non separet:</hi> where we see an Antithesis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Deus</hi> and <hi>Homo.</hi> Some question there was then, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man might seuer them; but none, that God onely did ioyne them together. Now if God onely ioyne them, then some in Gods stead must doe it. 2 <hi>Chronic.</hi> 19.11. <hi>Amariah</hi> the Priest had the charge of all things pertayning to the Lord. So the Apostle, 2 <hi>Corin.</hi> 11.2. expresseth by marriage, the contracting of the Church vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ: <hi>Desponsati vos vni viro:</hi> as if it belonged to the same to doe the one, that was to doe the other, to celebrate marriage, and to preach the Gospell.

I doe further wish, that priuate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts might not be cherished, the fountaine of so many adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, nullities, suites, confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and illegitimations, and that in great Families: And that, according to decrees made by <hi>Henry</hi> the first, our learned King, and Saint <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selm,</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in his time, Publike marriage in the Church might onely bee of force.</p>

The Serpent that bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the cure, is void of poyson. The Brazen Serpent was raised vpon a seat or height: so was out blessed Sauiour, as may bee vnderstood seuerall wayes, as either at the time of his passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or at his ascension, or as he
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:176970:33"/> was eleuated and exalted by the Preachers of his holy word. Though many decline from the opinion of his exaltation on the Crosse, yet considering that diuers Fathers of the Church doe make that construction, as also that in my poore opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is most consonant with the similitude, I dare not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue it: and so it is againe expounded plainely by Christ, <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.33. Those that beleeue aright, are said to beleeue in Christ crucified: for had not the innocent suffered death for the nocent, we could not haue obtained saluation. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt those who recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued cure by a dead figure and a liuely one, is, that those who beheld the Serpent, were onely cured in their bodies, whereas those who beheld our blessed Sauiour, &amp; embraced him with a true faith, were and are cured in their immortall soules, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:176970:33"/> thereby made partakers of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life. Sacraments haue then only their promised grace, when the eye of the receiuers faith is set vpon the thing they signifie.</p>
               <p>This confirmeth the doctrine of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>

Throughout all the contents of these verses, the drinking of his Bloud is as often repeated, as the eating of his Flesh, and with as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall extension. The like is in the Institution of the Sacrament, where Christ speaketh more emphatically of the Cup, then of the Bread; <hi>Drinke you all of this,</hi> as it were of purpose to preuent the error of the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists, who maintaine, that the Cup representing the bloud, may be omitted.</p>

               <p>Our Sauiour himselfe, who deliuered this Doctrine, was to dye concerning his body, and therefore hee spake not of it, but of the eternall death of the soule, whereto the Deuill and his angels are condemned, being vtterly debarred from the true life.

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:176970:86"/> intruders and seducers: for wee may obserue, that during all the time of the old Testament, the Writings of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Prophets, doe teach nothing but the pure seruice of the true God, by the mediation of the <hi>Messias</hi> who was to come. But after the returne from captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there arose vp <hi>Samaritanes, Sadduces, Pharises, Iusticiaries, Traditionaries, Herodians, &amp;c.</hi> and in all that time, vntill the comming of Christ, though these false teachers preuayled in the outward Church; yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen then God knew who were his, and Christs sheepe did heare his voyce. See <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.13. The very Progenitors of Christ from <hi>Zorobabel</hi> vnto <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,</hi> were not knowne, and had no vogue in the World, vntill by the Euangelists they are named; whereas the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupters of the truth kept both the Seat of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and Chayre
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:176970:86"/> of <hi>Moses.</hi> If it were so, when the Church of necessity had an outward visibility, because Christ was not yet come, how much more may it happen in these after-times, when Christs presence in his Church onely is spirituall.</p>
               <p>Christ would be vnderstood to be the doore, <hi>that is,</hi>

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:176970:90"/> iustified by her Children, I trust my paynes shall not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, since I study her peace.</p>
               <p>Our Feasts are all of Christ Iesus his Natiuity, Persecution, Circumcision, Epiphany, that is, manifestation to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, Death, Resurrection, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scension, Sending of his holy Spirit: Those of the blessed Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, our Lady, belonging also to her Sonne: for the Annun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation is of his Conception; the Purification, of his presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the Temple. We keepe also the Feasts of S. <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> the twelue Apostles; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomartyr Saint <hi>Stephen,</hi> and a Thanksgiuing for Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of vs by his Angels, and for the Saints in glory. The number is not great, nor the manner superstitious; but they are so many occasions to meete together, call vpon God, and to commemorate, with exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to imitation of them, the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:176970:90"/> mercy of our Lord Iesus, and the faith and constancy of his Saints. I will come to some particulars. In the Primitiue times, the faithfull, though it were in Vaults, (in <hi>Cryptis,</hi>) yet the Assemblies were vsed to be in some places where some ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Martyr was buried. Such may bee the literall meaning of Saint <hi>Iohn, Reuelat.</hi> 6.9. The soules vnder the Altar, that were killed for the Word of GOD, and for the testimony which they maintained: and the most probable meaning of that hard place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized ouer the dead</hi> (as our Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie readeth it) is gathered out of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> That the first Christians vsed to set their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistry or Font ouer the bodies of the Martyrs, both to honour the memory of those valiant <hi>Heroes,</hi> and to shew, it was the same faith, vnto which the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized were initiated, wherein
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:176970:91"/> the Martyrs dyed. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle seemeth to allude heereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6, 2, 34, &amp;c. where hee openeth the Doctrine of Baptisme by <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>Buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</hi> So their faith made them Martyrs, &amp; their Martyrdome Saints long before the Pope practised his Canonizations: For the whole Church in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, especially that, where the Martyrs suffered, ordained those anniuersaries in memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of the Saints, without any expectation or request of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s power, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by many of them kept in the Greeke Church, which the <hi>Roman</hi> Breuiary neuer took notice of. To come a little nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer the pressing of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; We may consider, that all our moueable Feasts they are centred, as it were, vpon the Feast of <hi>Whitsunday,</hi> being the last of them; the Dominicals, or Sundaies carrying the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:176970:91"/> forward: as first, second, third, &amp;c. after Pentecost; and the rest counting backward vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>till Aduent, doe meete againe with the last, as 50. daies before <hi>Whitsunday</hi> is <hi>Easter;</hi> three dayes before, the Passion; 4. dayes yet backe, Palm-Sunday, (for so long, it appeareth, Christ was in <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> before his betraying;) and so may we rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon of the rest. Now, to proue his Apostolicall, and the rest, I find my selfe vtterly debarred of vsing the testimonies of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, not because they are not pregnant, as appeareth by liuers of the Fathers Sermons, written <hi>De Tempore,</hi> especially <hi>Chrysostome, Austin, Eusebius, Emisseus, Leo, Haymo,</hi> and many others; but because, in this manner of controuersies with men that dissent from our Church, none of the Fathers are regarded. If therefore it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ppeare that the Apostles
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:176970:92"/> themselues kept the <hi>Whitsun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> I trust, men not giuen ouer to the spirit of contradiction, will receiue some satisfaction. See therefore <hi>Act.</hi> 2.1. Saint <hi>Luke</hi> plainely saith, That the holy Ghost descended when the fiftyeth day was commen; which must needs be accounted frō the Resurrection of Christ: So, as it were to giue vs instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to keepe those dayes in remembrance, he tells vs in the former Chapter, that Christ. after his rising againe, conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with his Apostles 40. dayes, to which the rest must bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to make them fifty. The Ceremoniall Law of the Iewes was now wholly abrogated; therefore of their Pentecost it were prophanenesse to thinke the Euangelists meaning; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther stood it with the honour of our Sauiour, to nobilitate their Feast with that glorious blessing. Why was it then
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:176970:92"/> done on the fiftieth day? Mr. <hi>Caluin</hi> saith that Christ chose his twelue Disciples, in resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the twelue Patriarks; (our Lord intimated so much, when he saith, <hi>They shall sit on twelue seates, and iudge the twelue Tribes of Israel:</hi>) and the 70 Disciples, to paralell the 70. Elders, vpon whom <hi>Moses</hi> spirit by God was imparted. Is it lawfull for M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Caluin</hi> thus to proue his intent by num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers? And are not these num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers too ceremoniall, and abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated as Iewish? and must the Feasts of the Church, hauing such ground, be accounted so? Surely the reason also is more pregnant: for as the Law was giuen on Mount <hi>Sinah,</hi> iust fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty dayes after the <hi>Israelites</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance from <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> so was the blessed Spirit shed on the Church, iust so many dayes after that Christ had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered vs from our spirituall
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:176970:93"/> bondage, whē he rose again for our Iustification. And this to be the reason, euen all our new Writers doe agree. For the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of the holy Weeke, and Good-Friday, the Apostle, treating of the institution of the Communion, whereby we shew the Lords death vntill he come againe, expressely saith; that it was done the same night wherein hee was betrayed; as warning vs to remember the Day, the third after which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Types and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, Iesus did rise againe. There is some ground also in the holy Story, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles did yerely keepe the <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunday:</hi> See <hi>Acts</hi> 18.21. &amp; 20.16. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> laboureth by all meanes to bee at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> at the Feast nay at the very day of <hi>Pentecost.</hi> He makes mention also of this Feast, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.8. To what end should hee doe so, and that at <hi>Ephesus, Miletum,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:176970:93"/> Corinth,</hi> all Gentile Churches, if hee had either meant the Iewish <hi>Whitsunday,</hi> or that the Church then had not kept the anniuersary of the sending of the holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>Concerning our moueable Feasts, a learned Bishop, lately in a Sermon before his Maiesty, deliuered. That in the times of our fore-Fathers, when the Word of God was precious, the Holi-dayes were a great meanes of instruction to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their faith, by remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the Conception, Natiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Circumcision, Temptation, Death, &amp;c of Iesus CHRIST. Now, the Diuell, to sow dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and make a rent of vs from the succession of the Church, and euen to extinguish this small light, by which, with farre greater, we finde the foot-steps of Truth in all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, hath so sharpened the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable zeales of some refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:176970:94"/> that they most bitterly inueigh against Holidayes; yea so farre, that they vndertake to proue, that our Lord was not borne in <hi>December,</hi> but in <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember.</hi> Their reason is taken from reckoning of <hi>Zachary</hi>'s Sacrificature in the Course of <hi>Ahiah.</hi> I would neuer spend time in following them in their curious questions of Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies: but in answer; If they know where to beginne to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and that it iumped with their computation, how can they prooue that there were Priests enow to make vp the number of 24 Orders, after the Schisme of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> and the ten Tribes, and especially after the Captiuity; the contrary ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appearing in <hi>Nehemias</hi> &amp; <hi>Ezra?</hi> Or how shall it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that after so many Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Kings, when not onely the Orders of the Priests, but euen the Booke of the Law was
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:176970:94"/> lost, and after the 70. yeeres discontinuance, the persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Seleueidae, Lagidae,</hi> the Conquest of the Romanes, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion of the <hi>Herods,</hi> of which times we heare that the dayly Sacrifice ceased, and the very High-Priest-hood was yeerely changed; How, I say, will it be proued, that <hi>Zachary</hi> was iust in his turne at the conception of Saint <hi>John Baptist?</hi> We read, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. That the instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the 24. Orders was by Lots; and it seemed that now they were so confounded, that euery yeere the Priests renewed that meanes, to know their courses: For so Saint <hi>Luke</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely saith, <hi>Luke.</hi> 1.9. <hi>His Lot was to burne Jncense.</hi> Some Ancients giue the reason of the times of <hi>Johns</hi> &amp; <hi>Christs</hi> birth, grounding by an allusion vpon the words of the Baptist, <hi>John</hi> 3 30. <hi>Oportet Illum augeri, me autem minue:</hi> That <hi>Iohn</hi> being
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:176970:95"/> the last and greatest Prophet, was borne the first day of the yeere, which begins to shorten when the dayes were at the longest; and Christ, (who came to restore the vtter misery of man-kind) the first day that begins to lengthen, when the dayes were at the shortest: So that <hi>Mid-summer</hi> Eue should be the longest, and <hi>Christmas</hi> Eue the shortest day in the yeere. Which is an Argument, that <hi>Gregory</hi> the 13. should haue resumed fiue dayes more in his reformation of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lender.</p>
               <p>But to leaue this to euery mans opinion, though I write not as Lord ouer my Readers faith, yet surely (me thinkes) it had beene impossible, that euer the Church should haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten the day and moneth of our Sauiours birth.

               <p>Concerning the Apostles dayes, our Lord, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. saith, That wheresoeuer the Gospell shall be preached, there also should <hi>Maries</hi> worke be remembred for a memoriall of her: and so the prayse of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and Martyrs (to vse St. <hi>Pauls</hi> words) is heereby in all Churches: which is vpon as good cause to be kept in the Church, as for <hi>Jepthas</hi> Daghter, the death of <hi>Josias,</hi> or <hi>Gedaliah.</hi> Mr. <hi>Greenham</hi> would allow ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lydaies for some remembrances of Gods extraordinary mercy but, forsooth, not ann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:176970:99"/> Sicknesse and death vnto good Christians, are not vnto death, that is, destruction, but vnto life and glory. See Chap. 6.37, 40. and 8.51.</p>

The third was <hi>Lazarus,</hi> who had beene dead foure dayes, and buried so long, that his Sister thought that hee had seene corruption: And this is the Type of obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, hardened, and irrecorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible sinfull men, who haue made a couenant with hell and death, to commit sinne with greedinesse, and to goe on still in their wickednesse; of whom the visible Church seemeth to haue no hope, but that they stinke, and are corrupt through their foolishnesse: yet euen these also, Christ is able, and often doth mercifully call to life againe by his grace and holy Spirit, though vnto all mens o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions

They had not yet receiued that fulnes of Spirit, to consider, that hee merited euen by his departure, the consummation of their happinesse: and therefore they grieued, as hauing respect only to what their eyes beheld; a Man aboue man, fraught with all perfections visible and inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.

Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> vpon this place saith; <hi>This Woman desired to remaine still with Christ, in the same estate shee had formerly done, before his Passion: and for ioy she conceiued nothing of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though the flesh of Christ was highly exalted in glory, by his Resurrection.

<pb n="329" facs="tcp:176970:172"/> faith, by which he must ascend to me into Heauen. So it was not fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to behold him with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer mind which they had of him before, because he was to depart, and to conuerse no longer with men.</hi> And this hee manifesteth in this which followeth; <hi>Goe to my Brethren, and tell them, J ascend to my Father and your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and my God, and your God.

But hee committeth no offence, who saith, That they then recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a certaine power of spirituall Grace, not to rayse the dead, and
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:176970:174"/> worke miracles, but to remit sins: Therefore it presently followeth, Whose sinnes you remit, &amp;c.</hi> It appeareth therefore by this place, and the iudgement of this Orthodox Father, that to the forgiuing of sinnes, &amp;c. there needed no such miracle, as to the working of wonders, and all good Ministers succeed to this, though not to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

<pb n="345" facs="tcp:176970:180"/> Life; so that they shall neyther dye of age, nor sicknesse, neither want any other corporall nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by meanes of which, the griefe of hungring and thirsting should be auoyded: For, they shall be endewed with certaine and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiolable immortality: So, as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their owne wils, they shall be fed by a possibility, not through a necessity. Euen as our Sauiour, after his resurrection in his spirituall, yet true flesh, did eat and drinke with his Disciples,</hi> Act. 10.41. <hi>not in regard of weakenesse, for want of food, but as an Argument of his power, by which he could so doe, when hee would.</hi>

But he said, I will haue him remaine,</hi> that is, <hi>liue vntill the end of the World, and then he shall suffer Martyrdome for mee. And therefore it is yet confessed, that hee liueth, but shall bee put to death by Antichrist, when as, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with</hi> Elias, <hi>he shall preach
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:176970:183"/> or professe the name of Christ, and though a Sepulcher bee assigned him, yet hee entred into it aliue, departing afterwards.</hi> Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> also saith, <hi>Or it may bee that some will contend, how that hee rather slept in that Sepulcher at</hi> Ephesus, <hi>then that hee lay there dead; taking his argument from the testimony that is giuen of the scattering, and, as it were, boyling and bubbling vp of the Earth there, affirming perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, that it is caused by his breath. Theodoret</hi> saith, <hi>Whereas the words are,</hi> Vntill I come, <hi>hee meaneth against the Iewes, who crucified him, striking them with the Staffe of the Romans: for it is said, that this Apostle conuersed thereabouts, vntill the time of</hi> Vespasian, <hi>when as Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem was taken.</hi> Some, euen in our Church, will haue this comming of Christ to haue beene, when <hi>Hierusalem</hi> was vtterly destroyed, and the Old
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:176970:183"/> Law abolished, and the Gospel generally preached throughout the World. And so the word <hi>(till I come)</hi> to signifie, Vntill my Kingdome be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in all Nations. Lastly, some interpret the words to haue reference vnto the Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation shewed by Christ vnto Saint <hi>John,</hi> whereby he became the most absolute Prophet of the New Testament, and saw all things before-hand, that were to happen to the Church vntil Christs second comming. I take not vpon mee to iudge of these opinions, but let euery one abound in his owne sence. Onely I suppose, this speech of our Lord concerning <hi>Iohn,</hi> doth import not so much a doubtful, as a sharpe answer to <hi>Peters</hi> cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious question. And therefore both Christ, and in the next words, Saint <hi>John</hi> himselfe doth confute the errour of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, concerning <hi>Iohns</hi> not
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:176970:184"/> dying, at leastwise they stay our curiosity, which hindreth vs in performing of our owne duties: as if he should say, What need'st thou care, how I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to dispose of him? Thou shalt finde enough to doe, that I command thee to take vp thy Crosse, and follow mee. Men that busie themselues about questions that ingender strife, eyther concerning God or their brethren, doe vnprofitably spend their time and zeale in that which concernes them not, and become carelesse in discharge of their owne due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>Hereof we haue in our times too plentifull experience, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther need wee maruell thereat: for not particular and priuate persons onely, but euen famous learned men, and whole Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches haue affected this forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fruit, to know what they needed not, whereas their
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:176970:184"/> hunger might haue beene satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the Tree of Life, which was easie to haue beene tasted of in the middest of the Garden. How did the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Easter vex the first A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges about the foureteenth day of March, and the order wee now keepe in the Latine Church, the cause euen to the excommunicating of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whereof was a matter of obscure &amp; vncertaine grounds? The too curious inquisition of the state of Gods Saints, after the resurrection, brought forth the Millenary errour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with so many great names, <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen, Lactantius, Iustine, Jrenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and many other both Greek and Latine Fathers were tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and whereunto Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> himselfe seemeth to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline: That <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; there put to death, As much as concerns the History, I think to be certaine. That hee was
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:176970:185"/> there fixed Bishop for fiue and twenty yeeres; It seemes to thwart his beeing an Apostle, and some passages in Saint <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 1. and 2. One <hi>Papias</hi> was the Author of this traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: whereupon began the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge of the Bishops of <hi>Romes</hi> superiority, reiected by some generall Councels, but now made an Article of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique faith; diuers particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches founded by seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Apostles, as Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> Saint <hi>Marke,</hi> Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> Saint <hi>Philip,</hi> Saint <hi>Andrew,</hi> haue produced diuers traditions as left by them, of great difference one to another.

               <p>Whence proceed all these
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:176970:185"/> inextricable disputations of Predestination, Election, and Reprobation: but because men are desirous, like the <hi>Philistins,</hi> to pry into the Arke of Gods counsels. How many presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Treatises haue beene fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abroad, and euen darkening the Ayre, of the time and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of our Lords last com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: defining the very sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which the Father hath put in his owne power; and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Christ Iesus, as he was the Sonne of Man, <hi>that is,</hi> as he was to reueale it to mankinde, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth himselfe ignorant? When these proceedings are set on foot, let vs thinke wee heare Christ speake to vs, as he did heere to <hi>Peter, What is it to thee? follow thou mee: Henoch</hi> was translated to be no more seene: <hi>Abel</hi> yet speaketh: Christ rose againe while it was darke: God hid <hi>Moses</hi> his body; and it is the Deuill that

<pb n="358" facs="tcp:176970:187"/>
                  <hi>who saw them themselues.</hi> See al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <hi>Act.</hi> 1.21. But now it may be obiected; What assurance could there be, that this testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was sufficient to proue the truth of Christs Gospell? I answere, It is true, that vnto an vnbeleeuer, the reports or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Apostles, was not bare of it selfe able to conuince their consciences, but they had many other testimonies to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the World. First, vnto all that did acknowledge the Scriptures, as to the Iewes, they proued the truth of Christ, by the authority of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as appeared by their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall Sermons, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. &amp; 3. &amp; 4. &amp; 7. at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and 8. to the Eunuch, and 13. at <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och,</hi> and 28. at <hi>Rome:</hi> And to the Gentiles, which acknowledged not the Law and the Prophets, they preached, taking proofes from the workes of GOD in Nature; <hi>Act.</hi> 14. at <hi>Lystra:</hi>
                  <pb n="359" facs="tcp:176970:187"/> and from the Gentile Poets, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. at <hi>Athens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Christ performed his promise, inabling them with his Spirit, which their Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries could not be able to resist, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.15. See the practice thereof in <hi>Stephen, Act.</hi> 6.10. <hi>And euen those who beleeued not, were yet conuicted in their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and despised the counsell of God against themselues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Word of God is alwayes pure, and giueth light to the eyes, and vnderstanding to the simple, Psal.</hi> 19.7, 8, 9. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that wheresoeuer it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the prouidence of God to open the doore, and suffer the Apostles to come, there the hearts of the hearers were ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to vnderstand and beleeue the Word that was preached.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, there was nothing in the Apostles Doctrine but suted to the publike good of the State of the Empire, and all
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:176970:188"/> Kingdomes, and also of euery priuate man, and disposed all men, besides the assurance of a better life, to all goodnesse and prosperity. Insomuch as when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer Christ was outwardly preached, the naturall consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of euery man, which is the light that inl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ghtneth euery mā that commeth into the world, did shake hāds, as it were, with the Word, &amp; submitted it selfe to the obedience of faith.</p>
               <p>Lastly, God gaue vnto his Church the power of Miracles, which followed their doctrine, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. and the grace of san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification in the liues of the Preachers, whereby the hearers were confirmed in the Truth which they had heard.</p>
               <p>But this place hath yet a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extension: For it is added, <hi>That wrote these things;</hi> as if Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> name did giue suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient authority to the Gospell which he wrote, to confirme
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:176970:188"/> it to be true: for the perspicuity thereof, we are to know, that the Apostles had authority frō Christ, both to preach &amp; write the Gospell. And hee that was by the Church knowne and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged an Apostle, his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles &amp; whatsoeuer he wrote in that kind, was obeyed as the Word of God: for the same authority that the Word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by them had, the same al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so had their writings. The 12. Apostles were as the 12. houres of the day, <hi>John</hi> 11. and when the night came, and they slept, that is, were dead, then the malicious man presently sowed his Tares of Heresie: Therfore saith our Apostle, 1 <hi>Ioh</hi> 2.18. <hi>J am est nouissima hora.</hi> St. <hi>Iohn</hi> was the last houre, and surui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued all the Apostles. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the saying that went among the Apostles, That hee should not dye, seemed to haue some ground: Therefore he prefixed
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:176970:189"/> before his two latter Epistles; <hi>The Elder to Gayus; The Elder to the Lady.</hi> And from hence we may learne, that there is a Spirit of Maiestie, which doth accompany the Scriptures, and walketh vpon the Letters ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as it were vpon the seuen Golden Candlestickes; and so the Word giueth authority vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it selfe. It is strange, how Learned men can, by the Stile, know and discerne the Writer, euen in Heathen learning: and much more may the stile of Gods Spirit bee knowne to those that doe partake of it. Secondly, the Apostles, as wee see by these words, <hi>[And we know that his witnesse is true]</hi> did not expect the confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church to whom they did write, to make their writings Canonicall; for it was true that he writ it, and so the Church ought and did accept it. Thirdly, it conuinceth the
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:176970:189"/> folly of many men in these gain-saying dayes, who deny the reading of the Scriptures to haue the power of Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching: for it is heere added, <hi>That you might beleeue.</hi> And in the last Verse of the former Chapter, <hi>And haue eternall life.</hi> See <hi>Luke</hi> 10.26. Christ being asked, how a man should at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine eternall life; He answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>Quomodo legis? How rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest thou?</hi> And, <hi>Ieremy</hi> 36. the King and Princes are taxed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause at the reading of <hi>Jeremies</hi> Prophecie by <hi>Baruch,</hi> they did not rent their clothes, and were conuerted. Surely, no man is more iniurious to the Word of God, than he that denyes that power vnto it, especially being read by one that is set apart for the Ministery thereof, which he cannot but discerne by his owne reading; yea, oftentimes, by reading good mens Bookes.</p>
               <p>But whether <hi>Iohn</hi> dyed at all,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:176970:190"/> or no, it is certaine he out-liued all the other eleuen Apostles: for hee continued vnto the Reigne of <hi>Trajan;</hi> and of this no man maketh question. I would gladly heere be satisfied one doubt, from the great Champions of the Romane Hierarchy: Three Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> succeeding after Saint <hi>Peters</hi> death, and before St. <hi>Iohns,</hi> Whether now were those three Bishops of greater authority than St. <hi>Iohn</hi> the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelist? If they were, then the Pope is greater than one of the greatest Apostles; which I finde none of them dare say: for <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and diuers of their learned men, deny that the Pope is equal to an Apostle. If the Pope were not Superiour to St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> then surely hee was not, then he is not alwayes the Head of the Church.<note place="margin">

               <p>Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> did not apply himselfe much to the writing
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:176970:190"/> of the seueral Miracles wrought by our Lord, as the other Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists did; but hee expresseth the high Mysteries vttered by Christ in his speeches, which in him are more frequent than in all the other three.
